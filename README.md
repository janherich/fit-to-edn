# fit-to-edn

Parsing .fit binary files (leveraging Garmin SDK through Clojure Java interop), 
retaining the original streaming capabilities of the Java API, exposing them
through `core.async` channels.

All processing is defined as transducer application over channels

## Usage

Finding maximal 1min power ever achieved in the directory containing .fit records:

```clj
fit-to-edn.core> (max-power
                  (list-fit-files "/Users/janherich/Documents/Training-data")
                  60)
566.567 watt
```

The same for speed:

```clj
fit-to-edn.core> (max-speed
                  (list-fit-files "/Users/janherich/Documents/Training-data")
                  60)
60.100 km/h
```

Overall best average speed ever achieved

```clj
fit-to-edn.core> (max-speed
                  (list-fit-files "/Users/janherich/Documents/Training-data"))
38.578 km/h
```
